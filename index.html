      Corey Lee is a designer based in San Francisco. As a partner at cLabs, he works on <a target="_blank" href="https://valoraapp.com/">Valora</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://celo.org/">Celo</a>. His work is based on understanding users and the models they bring to their interactions—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html">intuitive equals familiar</a>.

      He’s worked on some of the world’s most beloved products like Acrobat and PDF and has been an early employee at some successful and less successful startups. In a much too brief period in NYC, he helped launch <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/97738918">Feedie</a>, which would go on to fund over 12M school millions. It was, for the time, a pretty novel way to productize social media.
