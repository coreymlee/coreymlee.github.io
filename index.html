        I help mold emerging technologies into usable, understandable products.

        I was recently a Partner at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKggE5OvyhE">Celo</a>, where I hired and led the design team. As the first product designer, I developed research pilots with the World Bank and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.celo.org/how-the-grameen-foundation-successfully-delivered-humanitarian-aid-to-3-500-micro-entrepreneurs-2bb3d5b78ca9">Grammen Foundation</a>, built the design system, and ultimately launched <a target="_blank" href="https://valoraapp.com/">Valora</a>, a safe place to store and send money for anyone with a phone number. It became a standalone company in 2021 and is currently used for UBI programs, mobile payments, and remittances.

        At Adobe, I led product research for Acrobat and PDF, two of the most popular products in the world. I worked with engineers to shape AI/OCR tech into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H4nRx7r7nY">Adobe Liquid mode</a>, which was named a Best Invention of the Year by TIME, and more generally on next generation documents, which led to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUfcVznZndY">Acrobat DC</a>. Before that, I ran a small shop helping companies research, develop, and design their technologies, where I helped create <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/97738918">Feedie</a>, Brief, and Location Labs.
