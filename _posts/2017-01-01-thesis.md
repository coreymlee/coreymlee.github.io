# Thesis

My thesis looks at disruptions as a way to explore habits and behavior change. When we become attuned to technologies and gain an expertise around their use, they fade out of our attention. This is typically described in a positive light—removing thinking from our interactions allows us to move past the mundane on to new goals—but this process also exposes us to errors.

Focusing on objectives unrelated to the task at hand moves our awareness away from the present and its contextual nuances. The initial conditions upon which our automatized behaviors formed may have changed and our engrained responses may no longer be appropriate. In these situations, it makes sense for design not to disappear, but to disrupt and assert itself.

Objects, applications, and environments can be thoughtfully designed and vetted yet fail to realize the desired interactions of their designers because users have preexisting habits and expectations. Habits are behavioral tendencies; they guide our behavior even when they conflict with our conscious thoughts. They can be macro or micro in scale—from showering each morning to the way one holds a pen, from visiting family each winter to the sign up flow of mobile applications. I’m interested in considering habits and the disruption of habits as design tool.

Habits allow us to reduce the mental effort required for given tasks. This is an important part of what allows humans to be productive on a daily basis. It doesn’t make sense to be fully deliberate about every action we take. Some are complex and others are trivial. Donald Norman, noted design academic and cognitive scientist, divvies activities up by complexity across two spectrums: width and depth. Width is based on the number of possible outcomes; the task of ordering at an ice cream parlor with many flavors is wide, ordering at a fancy restaurant with a short pre-fixed menu is narrow. Depth is based on the number of decisions that need to be made; ordering ice cream is shallow because the process is complete once you’ve settled on vanilla, ordering an entire dinner is deeper because you must select an appetizer, entree, and a dessert. Norman explains that leisure activities tend to be wide and deep in order to be challenging mentally whereas everyday activities are narrow and shallow.

> After all, what challenge would there be if games such as chess or bridge were conceptually simple? How would interest in a mystery novel—or any novel for that matter—be sustained if the plot were straightforward and the answers readily deducible? Recreational activities should be wide and deep, for we do them when we have the time and wish to expend the effort. In the everyday world, we want to get on with the important things of life, not spend our time in deep thought attempting to open a can of food or dial a telephone number.

> Everyday activities must usually be done relatively quickly, often simultaneously with other activities. Neither time nor mental resources may be available. As a result, everyday activities structure themselves so as to minimize conscious mental activity, which means they must minimize planning (and especially any planning with extensive looking ahead and backing up) and mental computation. These characteristics restrict everyday tasks to those that are shallow (having no need for extensive looking ahead and backing up) and those that are narrow (having few choices at any point and therefore requiring little planning). If the structure is shallow, width is not important. If the structure is narrow, depth is not important. In either case, the mental effort required for doing the task is minimized. (124)


As Norman describes, this reduced effort allows us to perform simple tasks expertly while freeing our mind to focus on other matters. In this way, repeated behaviors have a way of disappearing from our consciousness.

The field of human computer interaction has often rallied around this idea. In his famous paper, The Computer for the 21st Century, Mark Weiser, the late Xerox PARC visionary, said:

> The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. [...]

> Such a disappearance is a fundamental consequence not of technology, but of human psychology. Whenever people learn something sufficiently well, they cease to be aware of it. When you look at a street sign, for example, you absorb its information without consciously performing the act of reading. Computer scientist, economist, and Nobelist Herb Simon calls this phenomenon "compiling"; philosopher Michael Polanyi calls it the "tacit dimension"; psychologist TK Gibson calls it "visual invariants"; philosophers Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger call it "the horizon" and the "ready-to-hand", John Seely Brown at PARC calls it the "periphery". All say, in essence, that only when things disappear in this way are we freed to use them without thinking and so to focus beyond them on new goals. (94)

Weiser hits on the same point as Norman, when we’ve become attuned to technologies and gain an expertise around their use, they fade out of our attention.

Norman and Weiser’s explanations tout the positive effects of removing thinking from the process. Both value moving past the “mundane” and onto “new goals.” This process, however, can also expose us to errors. Focusing on objectives unrelated to the task at hand moves our awareness away from the present and its contextual nuances. The efficiency of automatic responses is not universally worth the tradeoff of conscious choice. The initial conditions upon which our automatized behaviors formed may have changed and our engrained responses may no longer be appropriate. In these situations, it makes sense for design not to disappear, but to disrupt and assert itself.


### Sequences of Behavior


Habits form because our brains have grown accustomed to responding to certain situations in certain ways. This is an important part of what allows humans to be productive on a daily basis. Habits automate our behavior leading to quicker reactions and reducing the mental effort involved in repetitive tasks. When behaviors are isolated events, they require individual attention. When they can be grouped as habits, they require less mental deliberation. This automation is a double-edged sword; while plenty valuable to our daily lives, it can lead to mistakes. I’ll discuss two behavior errors here—one described by behavioral economist Dan Ariely and the second by cognitive scientist turned design academic Donald Norman.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-05.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-05.png" alt="" /></a>


Dan Ariely is the James B. Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavior Economics at Duke University and founded the Center for Advanced Hindsight. In Predictably Irrational, Ariely explains herding, a term that refers to the human inclination to do what we see other people doing. People in line at a cafe give us the impression that the coffee there is good or the pastries are tasty and so we join the queue. The longer the line the stronger the pull to join it. Now that you’re waiting, the next passerby sees an even longer line and faces even stronger encouragement to follow suit. This effect continues on, building upon itself.

Self-herding is an internal version of herding. Instead of basing our opinion off of other people’s behavior, we base it off our past behavior in similar situations. The herd is made up of past versions of ourself, rather than getting nudged by what others are doing, we’re nudged by what we’ve done previously. If we have a negative experience from this action, we may stop. Otherwise, we’re increasingly likely to repeat the behavior and then continue repeating it.


Ariely explains that at first we may have gasped to see Starbucks charge two or three times as much as Dunkin’ Donuts for coffee. When we decided to see what all the fuss was about, we made a conscious decision—perhaps, rationalizing that we were just trying it once and thus the extra cost was negligible. Ariely writes:

> The following week you walk by Starbucks again. Should you go in? The ideal decision-making process should take into account the quality of the coffee (Starbucks versus Dunkin’ Donuts); the prices at the two places; and, of course, the cost (or value) of walking a few more blocks to get to Dunkin’ Donuts. This is a complex computation – so instead, you resort to the simple approach: “I went to Starbucks before, and I enjoyed myself and the coffee, so this must be a good decision for me.” So you walk in and get another small cup of coffee.

> In doing so, you just became the second person in line, standing behind yourself. A few days later, you again walk by Starbucks and this time, you vividly remember your past decisions and act on them again—voila! You become the third person in line, standing behind yourself. As the weeks pass, you enter again and again and every time, you feel more strongly that you are acting on the basis of your preferences. Buying coffee at Starbucks has become a habit with you. (39)


Instead of weighing the pros and cons, behavior is guided by the past. In most cases, this works out fine—after all, those early choices were carefully considered and there’s no need to spend time deliberating over mundane actions. But when features from our initial encounters, the encounters in which our habits were formed, change, self-herding leaves us susceptible to poor decisions because we fail to account for these new factors. The error is one of over-generalization. Donald Norman identifies it as the capture error.

Norman works in the merged space of cognitive science, design, and usability engineering. As a faculty member at Harvard, Northwestern, and the University of California, San Diego, he’s advocated for user-centered design; he’s perhaps best known as the author of The Design of Everyday Things. In the best-selling book, he explains that the capture error occurs when we mistake a situation for a similar one:

> Our ability to generalize from small amounts of information helps tremendously in new situations; but sometimes we generalize too rapidly, classifying a new situation as similar to an old one when, in fact, there are significant discrepancies. False generalizations can be hard to discover, let alone eliminate. (105)

When two action sequences share the same initial stages, we may inadvertently mistake one for the other. This slip may cause us to react in error. We may find ourselves going down one path when we meant to go down another. The familiar task almost always captures the rarer one.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-06.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-06.png" alt="" /></a>

When we open a browser to search for something new, say, when we’re doing research for work, we sometimes find ourselves accidentally performing a more common behavior. For example, many people are used to opening a browser and going directly to their email or checking their Facebook feed. This has become a well-practiced sequence for a number of people. When we perform a task that shares the first few steps—click on browser icon, click address bar, place fingers on keyboard—we mistakenly perform the familiar task (check email) instead of the one we’re actually trying to do (research for work).

Thinking of habits as a sequence of events makes it easier to see that our behaviors can have a domino effect—causing us to perform actions simply because of preceding actions. Individual actions may have, at one point, been independent from each other, but through repetition they are now linked. When we’re in one of these chains, we’re nudged (even if just slightly) towards performing the next action—one domino triggers the next. Thus, our motivation and logic in a given moment is at least partially a function of preceding actions that may have little to do with the current one.

### Terrible Toothbrushes
<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis005.JPG"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis005.JPG" alt="" /></a><a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis006.JPG"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis006.JPG" alt="" /></a>


In the paper, Interventions to Break and Create Consumer Habits, the authors contend that habits inhibit intention. Bas Verplanken and Wendy Wood do so by referencing psychologist, HC Triandis:

> As Triandis...suggests, “when a behavior is new, untried, and unlearned, the behavioral-intention component will be solely responsible for the behavior.” However, “as behavior repeatedly takes place, habit increases and becomes a better predictor of behavior than behavioral intentions”... Thus, Triandis suggests a trade-off between intention and habit in guiding behavior. (93)

With new situations and new behaviors, we choose how to act or respond with a goal or intention in mind. We decide what we want, how to achieve it, and then do it. Over time, repeated behaviors cross a threshold into habit-ness and we lose some control over our actions. The longer standing the routine, the more potent the habit. Dan Ariely would call this self-herding because we’re no longer deliberating the costs and benefits, we’re simply behaving as we have in the past—leaving us vulnerable to capture errors.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-13.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-13.png" alt="" /></a>


Inspired by Nicholas Nova’s article, Relying on Failures in Design Research, Terrible Toothbrushes attempted to break this effect. by transforming a habitual behavior into a novel one. Nova suggested,

> If problems and mistakes are so interesting and insightful, why not be a bit more bold and enlist them as a design tactic? I am suggesting the conscious design of ‘questionable’ prototypes to investigate user experience. (68)

Volunteers were given toothbrushes purposefully designed to function poorly. In one, the handle has been drastically shortened. In another, half of the the bristles have been removed. The goal was to take a familiar activity and make it less familiar. Because of it’s design, this new toothbrush must be operated differently and the user cannot rely on muscle memory to perform the task. It was important that the brush was not designed so poorly that the task became completely undesirable or impossible. With these brushes, some of the usual motor skills still work or "sort of" work, but people still need to adapt.

<div class="video_wrapper size_16_9">
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/22155587?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


The brushes were used for two weeks. What I found was that people first needed to figure out how to use the brush; the foreignness of the new movement required more deliberate action. Moreover, the poor design and hard bristles (which all new toothbrushes have before being worn in) made it painful to brush quickly, again demanding more focal attention from the user. Volunteers commented that this focus made them more mentally present while brushing their teeth. They had to actively track whether they had reached each side of each tooth. Notably, some participants admitted they followed this activity by cleaning a second time with their normal brush to ensure full coverage—evidence they were actively questioning their dental health during the process.


When we disrupt our habits, by making a routine experience non-routine, we can reinsert awareness. By making this experience different, we can apply something other than the typical response. The goal was to reintroduce intention and the questions that come along with it: what am I doing, why am I doing it, do I want to do it?


### Disruptions

A study titled Changing Circumstances, Disrupting Habits suggests moments of disruption as windows for change. The authors, Wood, Tam, and Guerrero, describe research into natural moments of upheaval as starting points for behavior change, choosing two such scenarios: students transferring between universities and people moving to new locations.

In both cases, the data supports the assertion that abrupt changes to existing circumstances are conducive to behavior change. In moments like these, the circumstances that cue given behaviors often disappear.

> The present research capitalized on a naturally occurring event, transferring to a new university, to demonstrate the impact of stimulus cues on habits. Specifically, when the transfer involved a change in the circumstances in which students typically exercised, watched TV, or read the newspaper, habit performance was disrupted, and behavior tended to come under intentional control. (932)

Disrupting habits is a mechanism for behavior change that works by throwing our normal sequence of behaviors off. By differentiating the current experience from the routine, we no longer recognize the conditions that trigger the given behavior and our habitual response does not kick in. Put another way, the disruption makes the routine experience once again novel and brings intention back into the fold through awareness, conscious attention, and agency. This new found awareness allows for alternative responses, changing behavior and creating one data point towards a new habit.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-07.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-07.png" alt="" /></a>

Disruptions, in the form of moving or transferring schools, work because the trigger conditions no longer exist. These types of disruptions, however, require major efforts and therefore the opportunities for behavior change are limited to people facing these types of transitional moments. The third study considers smaller disruptions as a more applicable method of behavior change.

### Your Task Is

The second exploration looked at the way people attempt to change behavior on their own. Your Task Is involved recruiting a number of participants and asking each to try to add a task to their daily schedule. Some aimed to drink eight glasses of water and others tried to stretch for five minutes though the task itself was not of major importance. For all participants, the daily tasks were something they wanted to, but did not do regularly.

After two weeks, I interviewed each person to ask how they tried to go about adding the tasks to their day. Most people tried to rely simply on memory to remember to do them. This was a passive approach that led to interesting insights.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis022.JPG"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis022.JPG" alt="" /></a>

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis024.JPG"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis024.JPG" alt="" /></a>


Many people described items associated with their task acting as reminders—water bottles suggested hydration and running shoes evoked stretching. Likewise, another person said her keys reminded her to drink water because in order to refill her bottle she had to exit her studio and take her keys to get back in. In other words, the physical environment provided cues. These were inadvertent and developed organically, but nonetheless triggered behavior. In essence, participants transferred control of their behavior to their surroundings. External objects were imbued with a decision making power—people allowed the existence of some condition (water bottle is visible) to determine their behavior (drink water). Participants who doubled as my classmates said I, myself, took on this power because I reminded them of the task. As an animate object I could bump into them at less predictable times. Another person said he tried to drink three glasses of water with each meal. In this case, the decision making power transferred to an event or time of day.


Before starting the experiment, I expected the biggest impediment to success would be remembering multiple times a day to stay on track. The tasks weren’t particularly difficult (ability) and everyone had some measure of desire to complete them (motivation). The environment, however, stepped up to provide consistent reminders (trigger). It’s interesting to consider this phenomena in the context of disruptions. In the toothbrush exploration, the disruption was designer-imposed. In this study, the disruptions were self-imposed or developed on their own as participants began to associate various things with their task.

Even though the environment did work to cue the tasks, people also recalled remembering to do the tasks “randomly.” Because this description was so prevalent, I was curious to consider it further. As I compared notes, a commonality emerged. While people said they remembered randomly, it seemed people remembered the task during their downtime. This event occurs, for example, when an errand has just been finished or when people arrive home from work or school and they stop to consider what else they should be doing. It’s here that people check their mental to-do list and reflect on what else they should be doing.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-08.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-08.png" alt="" /></a>


One participant said, “when I have free time, I think about stuff I have to do.” She typically performed her stretching early in the day because that’s when she first remembered. On one particularly busy day, however, she’d forgotten until late in the evening. “Thursday was a late-day,” she said, “because I had no downtime.” She’s the type of person who does things as soon as she remembers them—even after a long day like Thursday. This was common among the most successful performers. They seem to have a special skill, perhaps a naturally high level of motivation, for doing things immediately. These special people are somewhat rare and really a separate group (some would say, these people make them sick). The issue for us regular people isn’t that we don’t remember what we’re supposed to do, it’s that we remember and regularly put it off. This is a pretty familiar description to a lot of us, even if logically it makes no sense.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-09.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-09.png" alt="" /></a>


People in the study were happy to have their tasks and interested in their deemed health benefits. Many even commented that they felt better because of them. But if we want to stretch and we remember to stretch, why don’t we stretch? The problem is that downtime is not ideal for performing a new task. It’s usually when people are tired and lack motivation. By relying on remembering “randomly,” we inherently try to perform new tasks at an inopportune time. This process is further detrimental in that not performing increases feelings of guilt and begins to create a new undesired sequence around downtime—we have downtime, don''t perform the task, we feel bad about it, and both downtime and the desired behavior begin to take on the emotion of guilt.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-10.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-10.png" alt="" /></a>


As we repeat this failure, this becomes a habit. We begin to associate downtime with feeling guilty, reinforcing our inner critic. To change this, it’s important to step back and realize the difficulty of doing something new at these moments. Doing so suggests two alternatives for intervention. One is obvious, find a way to increase motivation during downtime. The second is to identify when people would be more motivated to perform these tasks and work to trigger the behavior at those moments. Drawing lessons from the toothbrush project, disruptions could serve as an ideal means of both reminding and reinserting agency into these parts of our day.

### Environmental Context

Because habits are whole chains of actions, it’s important to acknowledge the first few steps in the sequence as much as the later ones. While it may be that we want to stop snacking, the experiences that precede snacking are just as important to consider—even if there’s nothing explicitly undesirable about opening the fridge, watching television, or whatever random activities come before one’s snacking. Verplanken and Wood write,

> Habits might be triggered by prior responses in a chain of responses; by environmental cues, such as time of day or location, by internal states, such as particular moods; and by the presence of typical interaction partners. (91)

These triggers motivate the entire sequence.

When this happens, a person loses agency to habits because the cues overwhelm intention. We learn to associate the context of the behavior with the behavior itself. In doing so, we find ourselves responding to the cue instead of the original intention.

> Habit learning is a cognitive and motivational process in which the control of action is outsourced to the environment so that sequences of prior actions are triggered automatically by the appropriate circumstances.

> Habit automaticity is evident in minimal awareness, in the sense that people do not need to attend closely to what they are doing when they habitually repeat prior behavior. Efficiency is evident in that habitually practiced actions are performed quickly, easily, with little effort, and in parallel with other behaviors. Lack of conscious intention is evident when habits are triggered by circumstances seemingly without people’s desire or wish to perform them. Finally, some habits are characterized by lack of control, meaning that it is difficult to avoid initiating the behavior or performing it in the same way as in the past (e.g., Betsch et al. 2004; Heckhausen and Beckmann 1990; Verplanken 2006; Verplanken and Orbell 2003). In short, the environment’s automatic activation of well-practiced responses is a key to the persistence of habits despite people’s best intentions. (93)

Efforts to change behavior should aim to change or eliminate the environmental cue so the situation is adequately differentiated from that which invokes the habit.

This association between environmental cue and behavior is key to change. The manner in which the cue is disrupted makes a difference. According to Wendy Wood, Leona Tam, and Melissa Guerrero Witt,

> Changes in features not central to performance should produce minimal disruption because they can be assimilated into existing patterns in memory (e.g., via connectionist pattern-completion processes). However, shifts in features consistently tied to performance in the past should interrupt fundamentally the activation of the learned response pattern. (920)

When trying to create behavior change, it’s necessary to look holistically at the entire sequence of actions. While the best solution could entail direct change to the behavior in question, it’s more likely to involve designs earlier in the sequence to disrupt the pattern that elicits the automatic response.


<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-03.png"><img class="size4" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-03.png" alt="" /></a>

### The Reminderer

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis039.JPG"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis039.JPG" alt="" /></a>

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis042.JPG"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis042.JPG" alt="" /></a>


For the third investigation, I provided each person with a small device, which came to be known as the Reminderer. The research probe was prototyped in a few shapes and sizes, but each functioned the same. Audio was recorded by pressing and holding the single button on the device. The sides of the device were kept clear to allow light to pass inside to an embedded light sensor. Audio playback was triggered when conditions changed from dark to light. Learning from the previous project, I added a means for logging progress. Some of the volunteers from the second study used tallies or spreadsheets to log how they were doing. They felt accountable to the maintenance of their records. I incorporated this idea initially by simply placing a sticky note on the Reminderer for participants to keep track. Subsequent versions were designed with an acrylic exterior to allow people to write directly on the nonporous surface (the ink wiped away with a cleaner).

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis052.JPG"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis052.JPG" alt="" /></a>

<div class="video_wrapper size_16_9">
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/25120112?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


In addition to the device, each person was asked to choose a habit they’d like to start performing at least once a day. As with the second experiment, the precise task was not that important, only that it was self-selected to enhance their motivation towards the goal.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-12.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-12.png" alt="" /></a>


Use of the Reminderer was left open for interpretation. Users could record any audio, place it where they wanted (within the constraints of the light sensor), and write any message on it. I pre-supposed that people would place the device in places related to their task. If they wanted to stretch, they might put it in their gym bag. If they wanted to floss, they’d place it in the bathroom. If they wanted to do something around food, they’d place it in the kitchen. A few people did use static places like this—placing it in a drawer, at the desk, or in the bathroom. The majority of volunteers, however, kept it with them wherever they went. They put the Reminderer in their bag or purse or in their jacket pocket. When I asked if they’d consider keeping it in a less mobile place, they shook their head. People said things like, “I wanted it with me at all times.”

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis048.JPG"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis048.JPG" alt="" /></a>

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis051.JPG"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis051.JPG" alt="" /></a>


It seemed people desired constant reminder, opting for quantity first and foremost. They wanted to be prompted repeatedly, keeping the task in the back of their mind on that metal to-do list permanently. The way the participants used and responded to the device would reenforce that.

People reported that the device, more than anything, kept the task in the back of their mind throughout the day. This is in contrast to what might have been expected—the Reminderer could have been a way to offload items from the to-do list. We might have thought the volunteers would remember strictly around the times when the audio was triggered, but the device was more pervasive than that. It utilized multiple mechanisms for reminding. In addition to hearing it, seeing it or feeling the Reminderer in a pocket also triggered memory of the task. The presence of the object was more of a reminder than the alert itself. The possibility of hearing the audio (not simply the actual playback) kept people on their toes. Because the Reminderer was imbued initially with a certain interactive capability, they felt accountable to it even when that primary function wasn’t actually employed.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-17.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-17.png" alt="" /></a>


As you might expect with such persistent reminders, participants did not act on each one. Sometimes the alert came at inopportune times, other times it came at points of low motivation; either way, a constant stream of reminders meant the task was often put off. This, however, led to a final insight: the Reminderer encouraged not one, but two reactions. The first was the obvious direct response to hearing the device—remember the task, do the task. In addition to that one-to-one response, however, the constant reminder engendered a more general behavior—what several people called a “conscious effort” to do the task. The reminder would often result in completion of baby steps—smaller, easier actions that facilitated completion of the actual task at a later point.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-11.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-11.png" alt="" /></a>


One participant, Andy said the Reminderer “wasn’t so much a reminder to do the task as it was a reminder to do it if it was convenient. If I had a cup of water on my desk, I would drink it right away, but I think more than that, it reminded me to keep a bottle of water at my desk.” A given task might require multiple steps—when steps are easier or fewer, the task is more likely to be completed. Of course, Andy’s task was easier when he had water at his desk. If the Reminderer went off at this moment, there was a high chance that he’d drink water. When it wasn’t there, the chances were lower. The existence of the Reminderer meant that he was more inclined to complete the early steps of the sequence so that the task was easier in the future. In this way, disruptions can be both a direct reminder and a less direct stepping stone. Both are equally compelling and can provide designers with alternatives when one or the other is unfitting.

### Behavior Change and the Fogg Behavior Model

Over the past decade, behavior change has emerged as an area of focus in design. BJ Fogg, founder and director of Stanford’s Persuasive Technology Lab, evaluates the effect of design and technology on human behavior. The Fogg Behavior Model characterizes behavior as a result of three factors: motivation, ability, and triggers.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-14.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-14.png" alt="" /></a>


Naturally, a person with greater motivation to complete a given task is more likely to complete it. The core motivators are sensation (pleasure and pain), anticipation (hope and fear), and social cohesion (acceptance and rejection). Increasing the pleasure, hope, and social acceptance or decreasing the pain, fear, and rejection associated with a task increases motivation towards it.

<a class="imageGroup" rel="group1" href="/images/thesis_illustrations-15.png"><img class="size1" src="/images/thesis_illustrations-15.png" alt="" /></a>


Ability refers to a person’s capability of performing a task. There are two way of increasing ability: training and simplifying. Training new skills may require a lot of effort and can be hard to accomplish, but sometimes it’s the only way to overcome obstacles. Where possible, Fogg prefers simplifying. By removing obstacles altogether and making the task easier to do, training isn’t necessary. He describes six components to simplicity—time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routine. By making the task quicker or cognitively easier to understand, for example, the person’s ability to perform the task is higher. Notably, a task can also be made to appear simple by managing the user’s expectations. Fogg says, “A task is perceived as simple if a person completes it with fewer resources than expected.”

Lastly, triggers are prompts to cue the task. Depending on the situation, the trigger may have slightly different functions. When motivation is high, but ability is low, Fogg suggests a facilitator trigger to make the behavior easier. When motivation is low, but ability is high, he suggests a spark trigger to motivate. When both motivation and ability are high, a signal trigger provides a simple reminder. “Sometimes a Trigger can be external,” Fogg writes, “like an alarm sounding. Other times, the Trigger can come from our daily routine: Walking through the kitchen may trigger us to open the fridge.”

In order for a behavior to occur all three elements must converge at the same time. In short, someone needs to want to do it, have the ability to do it, and be reminded to do it. By the same token, if a behavior does not happen, it’s because one of those elements is absent.


### Final Thoughts

We perform a vast number of actions over the course of a day. Though we often behave consciously, our minds and bodies are naturally disposed to finding patterns in our behavior. As we repeat certain sequences of action, we slowly carve grooves into our behavior. With more repetition, the groove deepens and becomes harder to change. Our behavior is guided by these grooves such that when we face similar situations in the future—when we repeat the first few steps of a sequence—our brain recognizes the pattern and sets course to complete the rest of the sequence. As described in this paper, the absence of deliberate attention that comes with well-practiced sequences leaves us susceptible to errors. One might suspect then that people in the midst of habitual behavior are prone to irrationality, but I don’t think that’s quite right.

People are rational. I remember sitting in a high school economics class, learning this phrase, and magically understanding the world. Human behavior boiled down to a simple process of maximizing people’s desires—whether that’s measured as pleasure, profit, or another standard. It may be true that when people sit and consider their options, they choose that which will provide the most happiness, but people don’t always approach their lives in such a calculated manner. It’s not worth the time and energy. This is itself a sign of rationality. An expensive cup of gourmet coffee may not be worth the extra cost every single day, but to spend time each morning evaluating its pros and cons would be troublesome. Thus, the rational decision to save time and energy outweighs the irrationality of indulging a pricey coffee habit. In this way, behavior has varying levels of logic. It’s not always clear what rationale a person is relying on in a given moment. Ethnographic and design research help identify the logic systems in play and in doing so inform our understanding of interactions.

Disruptions are a way of re-introducing awareness. The disturbance can be designed, but also has a tendency to develop organically as people gradually come to associate objects with a given task. In this way, control over one’s behavior may transfer to certain environmental cues. Reminders can directly trigger a behavior, but they can also have a second more indirect effect in encouraging people to take small steps towards realizing the full behavior further down the road.

Because routine behavior exists in all types of activities, understanding how habits and disruptions affect behavior has broad design application. It can affect how we use physical and digital products or spaces. It can affect behavior over the course of a day, but also during the few seconds we spend interacting with an object or interface. Disruptions help us escape our tendency towards self-herding and capture errors and design awareness into experiences when and where appropriate.
