Brief was just getting going when I met the founders, Jared and Martin. They'd done quite a bit of thinking around strategy, drawing parallels between the evolution of document management and that of internet search. The contention is file management technologies are still relatively undeveloped and in the same way that the internet required some means of organization so too does one's documents. Among other things, Brief was building a machine learning classifying engine to categorize users' documents. They were looking for contributions around refining concepts for the larger product idea and a proposed mobile app.

Brief's work is compelling because it operates at the file system level—one level deeper than most software design. Its goal of rearranging the way we sort and find documents raises design questions around managing information complexity, which I personally find fascinating and a little bit philosophical.


## Foundational Research, Nested Folders

My earliest conversations with Jared and Martin were discussions around the nested folder paradigm. This would become the primary constraint for Brief's UI.

Personal folder structures are curious things; they reflect users' relationships with their files—their "mental model" of the content. A given document's significance varies from person to person. Paul Dourish sums this up nicely: "In the everyday world, documents have different relevances to different users. A purchase order on my desk might, to me, represent the new PC I just ordered; to my manager, it is an element for her budget, and for our technical support staff, it indicates an upcoming installation task." Because a file can only live in one place, nested folders are constraining. This forces users with inherently diverse mental models into a single system.

When a directory is shared, its file structure may be created collectively or by a single person formally or informally "in charge" of the system. In either case, significant portions are organized according to someone else's understanding of the content. Users' individual models—the way they're inclined to think about their stuff—are unlikely to map perfectly to the shared system. As cloud storage services (Google Drive and Dropbox, for example) have become more popular, this has become a more common time drain.

Users feel a file system would be more useful if only someone went through and cleaned it up. There's a sense that there exists an obvious and logical hierarchy by which the file should be organized. But for all intents, one doesn't exist. There is no inherent common standard (only artificially mandated ones, which at least provide clear value over messy systems). In this way, most file management issues are collaboration issues.

There are fewer problems finding files within one's own closed system, but some exist. On local drives, with a single user maintaining a file system and later retrieving content from it, nested folders can be too rigid. An individual user's model may change from year-to-year, day-to-day, or hour-to-hour. This can reflect a change in perspective, but also general forgetfulness when a user can only remember specific features of a document.

While there was no specific prompt to remove folders—Jared and Martin left room for the possibility of working within the nested folder framework—Brief would need to address, one way or another, the problems posed by folders.

File management activities fall into two main buckets: sorting and finding. Sorting happens when a system is created and files are placed into it. It happens early. Finding happens when items are retrieved, days or years after sorting. It happens late. The two work together, which is to say, the distinction is a little artificial. If files are sorted "well" (by a specific user's standards), they're easier to find later. If the tools for finding are made better, users can be more haphazard with sorting. Still, sorting and finding are a convenient way of breaking up Brief's work. The plan was to build two lightweight prototypes (one to explore each area) before setting course in one direction.


_Brief Alpha_

Brief's Alpha was developed to test sorting. It was a Google Drive-based auto-filing service taking users' files and "automatically" classifying them into meaningful categories—categories more representative of users' mental models. On top of standard metadata (date created, file size, extensions, etc.), files were classified by document type (budgets, articles, wireframes, etc.), clients, projects, and authors. The classification technology was, in truth, Wizard-of-Oz'd—done manually (and laboriously) by Jared. The goal for the Alpha was to answer whether automatic categorization was valuable to users. To that end, it was put in front of twenty test users for about a month.

Users were keen on the new metadata and impressed that tagging was automatic (from their point of view), but we ran into interface challenges. Google allows developers to build apps specifically for Drive, but provides limited abilities for redesigning the Drive UI. That constraint meant that while the classification appeared beneficial, users had a hard time using the Alpha's features. About this, there was little to be done in the short term. The Alpha was put on hold—though the learnings would certainly be applicable down the road.

_Brief Mobile_

To improve finding, Jared and Martin's vision was to provide a mobile app. Brief Mobile would eventually combine multiple storage systems—first Google and Dropbox, then others—and allow consolidated search across them. The plan was to eventually use the Alpha's technology to enhance finding—by combining existing metadata (i.e., date created/modified, author, file extensions) with the brand new auto-generated metadata. Brief Mobile was focused on developing a finding interface given the new metadata provided by the classification engine. This prototype was my area of focus and what I'll devote the rest of this writing towards.


## Concepts and Themes

We developed three app concepts as starting points. Rather than elaborate on the apps themselves, I'll summarize broad themes and focus on what went forward.

__1. Filters not folders.__ File finding on mobile has taken its cue from the nested folder interface on desktop. As outlined earlier, this is problematic because folders don't accommodate diverse mental models (neither when sorting nor finding). The traditional desktop pattern is for users to navigate to a file by sorting through folders. At each level, the user has to know the exact next folder. In contrast, a filter-based UI allows the user to reduce the file set by whichever categories are known.

__2. Orient the user.__ From Don't Make Me Think, Steve Krug: "One of the ways navigation can counteract the Web's inherent ‘lost in space' feeling is by showing me where I am in the scheme of things, the same way that a ‘You are here' indicator does on the map in a shopping mall—or a National Park." The quote refers to website navigation, but holds for general computer usage. Navigating folders is disorienting; users need to know where they "are" and where that is relative to the files they're looking for.

__3. Multiple tools leads to multitasking.__ The process of fine tuning a query—to ensure it's neither too wide nor too narrow—involves toggling attention between the tasks of formulating a query and browsing a list of results, comparing "input" to "output," and adjusting as necessary. When users have multiple search tools (keyword search, folders, tags, sort), attention is spread in multiple directions—between each tool, and its specific function, and then the results. Reducing the number of tools, by consolidating their functionality or removing extraneous features, would reduce the cognitive load required to maintain a sense of all the moving parts.

Loosely speaking, I developed one product concept directed at each theme. The final prototype would, unsurprisingly, pull bits from each.


## Designing, Testing, and Prototyping

There are four tools at present for finding a file. Each one manipulates the corpus in its own way by filtering or re-organizing the content according to separate sets of metadata. Most interfaces provide at least three of these (tags are relatively new) and let users build queries by combining them. The goal is to filter the corpus as narrowly as possible while also keeping all desired content within the set of matches.

![Alt text](webkit-fake-url://683923A7-A9C0-4A9B-9D41-21FE2FE1FC8D/pastedGraphic_1.png)

A good question here might be: If folders are problematic, why don't users ignore them and just search? When implemented well, search is a powerful tool . It provides wide access to a file's data, including its contents, not just header metadata. The larger scope increases the likelihood that what the user can recall about a file (particularly, context-specific info like client names, authors, or document types) is actually useful. Despite noting its value, most test users admitted search was a very secondary finding strategy. This behavior, on mobile, is perhaps unsurprising because touchscreen typing is a major pain point, but even on desktop users favor navigating folders.

Our hypothesis is that this is a response to the lower cognitive effort of choosing from a list of prepopulated options. Because folder and tag names are supplied, they're suggestive and serve as a cognitive aid. A search field is open-ended, making it less constraining, but demanding more independent thought. Presenting a short list of options simplifies the process (provided at least one of the options resonates). Combine this with the mouse's (or trackpad, or touchscreen) ability to translate physical pointing to a two-dimensional screen and the experience of selecting an option is superior to the search field.

Brief's primary technology becomes really valuable here because it provides the materials for an interface built around these cognitive and gestural preferences.

_Classification_

The thrust of Brief's would-be technology was Martin's classification engine, which indexes a user's documents. It automatically categorizes and tags context-specific information—things like document-type (contracts, wireframes, proposals, articles, etc.), clients, and project names.

Design is often tasked to build towards a notion of simplicity. Simple interfaces hide complexity underneath the console away from users. By organizing and prioritizing information into hierarchical groups, an interface reduces the number of options available in any given interaction. The architecture conceals and then "progressively discloses" functionality when it becomes relevant.

Rather than show all messages together in one overwhelming screen, an email client, for example, might organize its functionality by inbox, outbox, drafts, trash, and settings. Choosing "outbox" makes available only those emails a user has sent herself and selecting a message then allows for replying, forwarding, or deleting. Importantly, this [displaces complexity rather than removes it](http://hellofosta.com/2013/08/05/the-simple-truth/). When a screen is cluttered full with every possible interaction, the user is faced with one difficult task: Choose one from many. When organized, the task involves multiple easy questions: Choose one from a few options, then one from another few, and on and on. The two flows are complicated in different ways and finding an appropriate degree of organization is a key design task. Brief's classification engine drives a very similar question.

When unorganized, a large, complex set of objects is difficult to draw meaning from. Classifying orders the unwieldy set into smaller digestible chunks. For the process to have value, it has to hit a sweet spot. If the raw information is simple to understand on its own, categorizing is unnecessary clutter. Five files, on their own, are easy to grasp; adding folders, tags, or other tools only confuses things. If the data is really diverse, categorizing  doesn't do much. Sorting one hundred very different things into one hundred categories isn't that helpful. Categories hit the sweet spot when the dataset can be sorted into meaningful groups. The categories have to be general enough to reduce the dataset and specific enough that users understand their organizing principle(s).

If Brief were trying to organize the entire web (as Google might) or most of the products in the world (as Amazon might), the number of categories would be tremendous. That initial layer of hierarchy reduces the total number of websites (or total number of products) substantially, but the second layer is still too large to sift through piecemeal. Because Brief focuses on documents, the corpus is narrowed enough to abstract the dataset into broad, but meaningful categories.

_Interface_

Brief's interface reworks the functionality of the four tools into primarily one: tags. The categories provided by the classification engine are well-suited to be used as tags. As noted, the project began with the notion that folders are too rigid, unable to flex to the diverse perspectives of users. While search is useful, it's a high-risk-high-reward proposition; the relatively high mental and gestural effort may or may not be fruitful.

Tags are the natural response to this obstacle; whereas a file can only "live" in one folder, it can "have" multiple tags. With folders, the structure appears in addition to files (in fact, folders are files) blending content and organization. Tags prioritize the file object; the organizational structure is part of the file (as metadata) making it more modular and, thus, more accommodating of diverse mental models. Not only can different users go about finding in different ways, individual users can filter one way today and another way tomorrow.

To date, tags have been implemented tepidly. They're often relegated to second or third duty. They're an "extra" tool tacked on _in addition_ to folder navigation and keyword search. This, I suspect, is because tags are relatively young and still somewhat foreign; users, and thus software designers, have shied from adopting them over the clunky, but familiar folder system. On top of this, files have to be tagged first. There's an onboarding period where the user sees little benefit and a lot of work. People have been willing to manage folders for some time—creating, naming, and editing large file directories—but have been less forthcoming maintaining tag systems.

With folders, the mental model is a physical one. Each is its own "space" with its own content. The user navigates folders to move between spaces. The available files are limited to what's in a particular folder. Brief's model is more amorphous. All files exist in a single space—one very big folder—and the user filters what's visible by selecting tags from the menu. While the trait menu swipes for easy access to filters, the document area stays fixed. The user stays in one place. This minimizes the need to maintain a map of the system or recall previous navigation. Feedback about current filter activity is embedded in the menu.

__Search.__ Because of the emphasis on filtering by category, we can minimize the need for typing. Input on a per character level is unnecessary, search is too high-fidelity for most use cases. It's still available, but lowered in priority. It's a catchall when a file isn't represented well by the list of supplied traits. When this happens, it makes sense for a user to resort to the familiar pattern of entering specific keywords.

__Sort.__ Sorting is largely used in combination with other tools—after a corpus has been filtered into a smaller set of items. This allows the user to impose linear order onto the remaining list as a browsing aid. Because user activity is highly slanted towards recent files, we hardcoded the list into reverse chronological order and removed other types of sorting. Keeping them at the top of the file list, with or without any filtering, prioritizes their accessibility. Supporting multiple sorting methods overestimates users' ability to recall "precise" features about files. The memorable features of older content are context-based—things like authors, project names, and document types—which are likely captured in the UI as traits. It's more difficult for users to remember exact filenames, thus, sorting content alphabetically isn't that helpful.

_User Research and Testing_
The small-ness of our working group and the early-ness of Brief's work made for an agile process. It allowed us to design, test, and update the prototype after individual conversations. Altogether, about fifteen people used the prototype. The interviews generated quick fixes to small UX issues, like copy edits for button labels and minor changes to placement of buttons and spurred conversation around larger questions.

__Sharing Documents.__ The early version of the app centered around the extended use case of not just finding files, but also sharing them. This led to a feature which took the app's namesake: after finding files, a user adds them to a "brief" in order to send them to others. During user research, participants commonly offered how they might use one brief for this and another for that. This revelation shed some light on interviewee mental models and clued us in to important product questions.

The desire for multiple briefs suggested a desire to use the brief as a folder. Here's an excerpt from an email thread we had mid-way through our research:

> Peeling this apart some more. In function, our Brief is more like a tag/sticker we stick on the files you chose. And it''s temporary—not in the sense that it vanishes, but it's value is mostly short lived. The purpose, the reason you did the collecting, is to transport (or share) files not to store them.If I''m focused on the Brief, I might be missing the point. The Brief is the envelope, which gets tossed once I get the files. Or maybe the mailman, who leaves post-delivery. That people are asking about multiple Briefs hints they''re thinking more permanently. You need multiple if you''re trying to save them for later. It'd be problematic if people are telling others (or just thinking to themselves), "That file you're looking for is in Brief XYZ." A permanent Brief sounds a lot like a Google Drive "folder" (a bunch of tags disguised as a folder, but allowing a file to be in more than one place). A temporary Brief sounds more ethereal, less physical like an email (or a "conversation" like Carousel uses). They''re still retrievable, they might still have some use in the future, but they're not created with the purpose of long term use.

Given our fundamental premise to move away from folders, we wanted to shift users away from thinking about the brief in this way. Rather obviously, our stand-in briefcase icon too closely resembled a folder. More generally, the terminology of a "brief" or a "briefcase" was tricky. These items are physical metaphors—neither temporary nor able to exist in multiple places at once. Nudging the user model required iterating on a product-level, rather than (or in addition to) a usability level.

The process highlighted UX issues, of course, but more generally grew our vision of the product itself and its likely users. It helped reveal the more essential "purpose" of the software. The app was whittled down to center more fundamentally around the core functionality of finding, temporarily removing the sharing features. The use case was more simply: find a file, open a file.

__Time Intervals.__ From the start, we took the approach of using singular time intervals. This would constrain potential time intervals, but dramatically clean up the interface. So rather than allow the user to enter separate start and end dates (similar to reserving a roundtrip flight on an airline website), we used options with implied timeframes. We began with:

* Today
* Yesterday
* This Week
* Last Week
* Last Month
* Last Two Months
* Older

For the sake of screen layout, we aspired to keep the number of options to four. Today is the most important timeframe (carpe diem!), but we found people think of it more in terms of "recent"—they're more concerned with which documents are active than which ones were worked on that day. The slight difference allowed us to trim Today and Yesterday. Because documents are listed in reverse chronological order, recent items are already prioritized. Filtering by Today or Yesterday is unnecessary and captured by This Week anyhow. We ultimately settled on:
* This Week
* Last Week
* Before Last Week
* Over a Year Ago

This proved the best balance between understandability and usefulness. We realized start dates were more crucial than end dates. With recent items displayed first, the only visible change when interacting with the time filters occurs to items at the beginning of the timeframe. Items at the end are too far below the fold to be noticed. And for older content, there's little reason to truncate the end of the list at all; it would be frustrating for a user to scroll through a slew of items only to be halted abruptly as they neared what they were looking for. Instead, the results are paginated and the user can scroll infinitely into the past.


## Prototyping Notes

I built the prototype as a Javascript webapp and masked it to function as a native iPhone app. As a front-end prototype, it used test data rather than pulling from a user's personal files, which meant a tradeoff of some real world unpredictability. From a development perspective, it meant, Martin, Brief's CTO, could focus on the classification engine. Designers are consistently looking for prototyping methods that have a reasonable degree of polish and aren't prohibitively technical, I thought this method worked very well in those regards.

The final prototype had the following functionality:
Walkthrough tour
* Swipe-able menus
* Functional filters
* Animated (but non-functional) search bar
* Modal previews
* Toast messages
* Favorite queries
* Add-to-Brief functionality
* Editable query display


## Conclusion

Brief Mobile hopefully provides a compelling alternative for interacting with one's files. Automatic classification allows the folder structure to be removed and opens the interface to a model that better supports diverse users. The native iOS app was developed shortly after user testing, though it hasn't launched on the App Store (and possibly won't). While it was a wonderful product to work through, it didn't quite caught the required gaze of investors.
